# React + Vite Smart Technology Task

- A responsive design project for mobile and desktop.
- Feel free to switch between Dark and light mode.
- Project made with react.js, Tailwind(npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite), Daisyui(npm i -D daisyui@latest).
- Icons from Fontawesome so install it or run ('npm i' to install all the requirements).
- Don't forget to add the daisyui plugin to Tailwind and import tailwind in css!
- Axios to fetch the API for speed so install it ('npm i axios').
- I have only slice and map the first ten data from the API to print it.
